        <p>Hello! My name is Alejandro Paz, I’m 20 years old and I live in Maracaibo, Venezuela. I’m currently studying software development because I want to find a good job and build a better future. One of my biggest passions is music — I play guitar and cuatro, and I’m part of the youth choir at my church. I also enjoy learning new things and working on creative projects. In the future, I would like to focus on front-end development, because I really enjoy designing user-friendly interfaces and making websites look clean and professional.</p>
